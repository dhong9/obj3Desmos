# obj3Desmos
Converts an OBJ file to a format that Desmos can read.

## How to use
After cloning the repo:
* Run `npm i` to install dependencies
* Run `npm start` to start the application

Use the Upload button to upload your OBJ file. The smaller the file, the quicker the processing time will be. Use the Parse button to get your output text file.

**Notes**
This will give you points without lines. You will need to change the settings manually after you paste the output into Desmos.
